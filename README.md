# XPerl::Installer

The installer resolves a module through CPAN's `02packages` index, fetches its
original release archive, and can build, test, and install a `Makefile.PL` or
`Build.PL` distribution into an explicit prefix. It recursively installs
declared required prerequisites. With `--registry DIR`, it applies known
patches from the local `xperl-cpan-ports` repository before building. The CLI
uses XPerl's `dispatch/on` syntax.

Build and install this distribution with an installed XPerl. The commands
below assume a Perlbrew installation named `xperl` and run from this
repository's root:

```sh
prefix="$HOME/perl5/perlbrew/perls/xperl"
export PERL5LIB="$prefix/lib/perl5${PERL5LIB:+:$PERL5LIB}"
"$prefix/bin/perl" Makefile.PL INSTALL_BASE="$prefix"
make
make test
make install
"$prefix/bin/perl" "$prefix/bin/xperl" resolve Sereal::Decoder
"$prefix/bin/perl" "$prefix/bin/xperl" fetch Sereal::Decoder
"$prefix/bin/perl" "$prefix/bin/xperl" install --prefix "$prefix" Example::Tiny
```

The installed interpreter runs the installer and every CPAN build and test.
The explicit `PERL5LIB` makes modules installed under `prefix/lib/perl5`
available to later commands. During development, the installed XPerl can run
`bin/xperl` from this checkout. The source directory does not enter CPAN
build paths. End users can run ordinary installs without changing or
rebuilding XPerl.

To install the current Sereal releases with local compatibility patches:

```sh
"$prefix/bin/perl" "$prefix/bin/xperl" install --prefix "$prefix" --registry ../xperl-cpan-ports Sereal::Decoder
"$prefix/bin/perl" "$prefix/bin/xperl" install --prefix "$prefix" --registry ../xperl-cpan-ports Sereal::Encoder
```

`--cache DIR` selects a download cache directory; the default is
`$HOME/.xperl/cache`. `--workdir DIR` keeps unpacked builds, logs, and receipts
separate from downloads; by default they go under the cache's `work/`
directory. `--mirror URL` selects an HTTPS CPAN
mirror. A local mirror directory with `modules/` and `authors/id/` subtrees is
supported for tests. `--refresh` fetches the index and archive again. Registry
lookup is optional and does not require an AI agent.

The registry root contains `registry.json`. The installer combines the CPAN
author from the resolved archive with its distribution name, then uses jump
consistent hash to choose a data repository and a fixed SipHash prefix to
find that author's patch index. A registry without `registry.json` retains
the original flat layout for compatibility. The current shared registry has
one active data repository. CPAN archive paths may include subdirectories
under the author; those directories do not change the registry key.

The command reports the archive's SHA-256 digest for reproducibility. This
checkpoint calculates the digest but does not yet authenticate it against
independent CPAN checksum metadata. Install writes phase logs and a JSON
receipt under the cache's `work/` directory. It stops before installation
when configuration, build, or tests fail. A configure step must create its
Makefile or Build script even if the process exits zero. The installer resolves
required prerequisites from the release metadata, then checks generated
`MYMETA.json` or `MYMETA.yml` after configuration for additional required
prerequisites before building. Older metadata is converted before validation,
so fixable fields such as a missing abstract do not block dependency
resolution. For releases with no META file, the archive filename supplies the
distribution name and version for registry lookup; generated MYMETA can still
provide prerequisites after configuration. Optional prerequisites are not
installed automatically. `Build.PL`
distributions need their build
tool, commonly `Module::Build`, installed or declared as a required build
prerequisite.

The runner uses cpanm's noninteractive build signals. Configure, build, and
test set `PERL_MM_USE_DEFAULT=1`; test also sets
`NONINTERACTIVE_TESTING=1`. Configure sets the CPAN-running markers used by
some older build scripts, plus `PERL5_CPAN_IS_EXECUTING` for Makefile.PL.
Each build phase identifies the current interpreter through `PERL` and sets
`PERL_USE_UNSAFE_INC` from
the distribution's `x_use_unsafe_inc` metadata when present, or to `1` for
older distributions, while preserving an explicit caller setting. The
variables are scoped to the child command. The installer does not set
`AUTOMATED_TESTING`, which denotes smoke testing rather than installation,
and it leaves color settings such as `NO_COLOR` to the distribution's tests.

## Optional repair command

`--repair-command PATH` enables an external repair program after a failed
configure, build, or test phase. `--repair-attempts N` limits repair calls;
the default is two. `--repair-timeout SECONDS` limits each call; the default
is 600 seconds. The installer never calls a repair program unless this
option is present. The command must be an executable file. It runs with the
distribution source directory as its working directory and receives one
argument: the absolute path to a JSON request file.

The request has `schema: 1`, the module and CPAN archive identity, source
digest, XPerl executable and version, attempt number, source directory,
failed phase, command, and log path. When a registry patch set names migration
recipes, `recipes` contains their IDs and absolute Markdown paths. The
program should edit the source tree and exit zero when ready for another
build. A nonzero exit stops installation. The installer reruns configuration,
build, and tests after each successful repair call, and records every phase
and request in the receipt. Installation runs only after the tests pass.

After a successful repair, the installer writes `proposal.patch` next to the
receipt. It compares repaired source files with the untouched CPAN archive,
includes files added by registry patches or the repair command, and leaves
ordinary build products out. The patch includes any known registry changes
so it applies directly to the original release. A dry run against a fresh
copy of that release must pass before installation. The receipt records the
proposal path, file list, and SHA-256 digest for review.

The repair program can be any agent wrapper that accepts this protocol. A
Codex wrapper, a Claude wrapper, or another tool receives the same request
and must return the same exit status and source edits. The request contains
no provider-specific fields. Credentials and provider settings belong to the
wrapper, not the installer or its receipts. The installer does not bundle an
AI service or submit generated patches yet.
