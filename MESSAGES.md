install-ported is up for review: https://github.com/demerphq/xperl-installer/pull/1
(batch command, platform in receipts, and three macOS fixes, including a
real repair-loop bug with make 3.81's one-second timestamps). Selection rules
are in its README under "Validating recorded ports"; please say if you want
them changed.

Full macOS arm64 run over all 378 recorded successes is past 220. Findings so
far:

- Three registry patches only apply with GNU patch (POE-Test-Loops, POE,
  Sub-Delete). Regenerated with `diff -u` plus a `t/patches.t` structure
  check on `atomicstack/platform-observations` in xperl-cpan-ports; PR to
  follow with the run's results.
- That branch also makes import-receipts keep results per platform. Your
  existing observations show as `unrecorded`. Are they all
  linux/x86_64-linux, so they can be backfilled?
- In the Task::Kensho tree (yours, recorded only): Text-CSV_XS 1.65
  segfaults in t/30_types.t, and bareword-filehandles 0.007 fails on an extra
  "Not enough arguments" diagnostic. The Text-CSV_XS crash may not be
  Kensho-specific.
- POE 1.370 fails t/90_regression/somni-poco-server-tcp.t (TCP event
  ordering); I'm checking whether it's macOS rather than XPerl.
